# booKING 

## Orbital 2021

## Motivation 
With the limited venues and resources available in School of Computing, students struggle to find a proper venue to study or to work on group projects. Even if a vacant venue is found, students are also uncertain whether the room is currently occupied, or whether it will be occupied halfway during their usage. In addition, if they want to use it for project meetings or discussions, they are also unsure if the venue itself has the relevant infrastructure (such as projectors, computers or seats) to suit their requirements and preferences. 

---
## Aim 
To maximise the venue and resources usage in School of Computing, we hope to help users find and reserve a venue for their own usage through a simple and user-friendly web application.

## Qualifications 
Both of us have experience with programming using Java and Python (explored python in our free time and are currently learning Java from CS2030S this semester) hence we are confident that we will be able to utilise GOLang which is similar to both languages. 

We also have basic knowledge in CSS and HTML to code and design websites (Jason has experimented with it during the MOOC course CS50 by edX while Jie Wei has designed a webpage for one of his course projects back in Temasek Polytechnic). In the same way, we have also integrated MySQL together with the websites we have designed.
